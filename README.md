# Compiler-based-Messenger
The compiler-based messenger project built in C++ is an application that allows users to communicate with each other through a command-line interface. This project utilizes various data structures and algorithms, such as doubly linked lists, linked lists, and vectors, to efficiently manage user data, messages, and trash messages. Here's a description of the key components:

User Registration: The application allows users to create an account by providing their username and password. The user data, including the username and password, is stored using a data structure such as a linked list or vector.

Login/Logout: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their credentials. Once logged in, they gain access to the messaging features. Users can also log out to end their session securely.

Change Password: The application provides an option for users to change their passwords. This functionality involves traversing the user data structure to find the user's account and updating their password accordingly.

Inbox/Sent Box: Users can check their inbox and sent box to view their received and sent messages, respectively. The application can use a doubly linked list to store message data, with each node representing a message containing information such as sender, receiver, and message content.

Trash Messages: The project includes a trash feature where users can move unwanted or deleted messages. These messages can be stored using a separate data structure, such as a linked list or vector, dedicated to storing deleted messages.

Message Storage: The application can employ various data structures and algorithms to efficiently store and retrieve messages. For example, a doubly linked list can be used for storing messages in chronological order, while a linked list or vector can be used for dynamic storage and easy access.

Data Management: The project ensures efficient management of user data and messages using appropriate algorithms and data structures. This includes operations like insertion, deletion, and searching, which are optimized based on the chosen data structures.

Compiler Integration: As a compiler-based project, the application leverages the features and capabilities of a C++ compiler. It may use libraries, syntax, and functionalities specific to C++ to enhance the overall performance and functionality of the messenger application.

Overall, the compiler-based messenger project in C++ combines data structures and algorithms to create a command-line interface that enables users to create accounts, sign in, change passwords, and manage their messages efficiently. It utilizes doubly linked lists, linked lists, and vectors for storing user data, messages, and trash messages, respectively. The project aims to provide a robust and optimized messaging experience through the integration of various C++ compiler features.
